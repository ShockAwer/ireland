print "I was born on a Dublin street where the Royal drums the beat
And the loving English feet they went all over us
And every single night when me da' would came home tight
He'd invite the neighbors out with this chorus
Come out ye black and tans, come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra"
